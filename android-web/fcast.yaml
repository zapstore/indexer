description: FCast is an open source protocol that enables wireless streaming of audio and video content between devices, supporting various stream types such as DASH, HLS, and mp4. Unlike proprietary protocols like Chromecast and AirPlay, FCast offers an open approach, empowering third-party developers to create their own receiver devices or integrate the FCast protocol into their own apps.
